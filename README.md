# 🌤️ My First Weather App

## ✨ About the Project  
This is one of the very first projects I built when I started learning to code.  
It’s **simple**, but it’s **special** to me because it gave me the confidence to keep building more! 🚀  

At the time, I was just excited to see my code **actually doing something in the real world** — like showing the weather for my city!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **HTML** – For the basic structure  
- **CSS** – To make it look nice (and a bit stylish 😎)
